Module SynchroMapper.py allows for synchronized job mapping through AMPQRabbit.

To use Synchromapper, simply import it into a project and call Synchromapper.ExecuteMap(numnodes, exchangeName)
ADDED NOTE: Add the url for your rabbitmq service to a file named amqkey.txt in your working directory in order to use your own rabbit service

Function explanation:

ExecuteMap(numnodes, exchangeName):
    """   
    Performs the split mapping through pywren and prints the results of the process through standard output.
    Params:
        numnodes: the number of map nodes you wish to spawn
        exchangeName: the exchange you want the nodes to use for communication. IF THE EXCHANGE ALREADY EXISTS, 
			IT MUST BE CONFIGURED FOR FANOUT TYPE. If it doesn't, the function will create it.
    
    Returns: Nothing
    
    Output:
        The output format is a list of dictionaries, where list[0] is the output from the master node (which
        stores the order in which nodes have written), and then the ordered output of each node as a dictionary
    {node_identifier:map_results}
